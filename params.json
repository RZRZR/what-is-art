We don't often get the invitation to think about something without being asked for an opinon.\r\n\r\nThat opinon could possibily affect your job or personal relationships. Or we're being sold something.\r\n\r\nArt is created deliberately with a predetermined purpose or message, but is free to subjective interpretation.\r\n\r\nYour personal interpretation can and should change with time. This is OK.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
