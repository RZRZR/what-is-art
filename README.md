# What is art?

Art is an invitation to think.

Art gives us the catalysis to think about something new, or differently, without repercussion in our everyday lives.

Our lives are busy. We don't often get the invitation to think about something without being asked for an opinon.

That opinon could possibily affect your job or personal relationships. Or we're being sold something.

Art is created deliberately with a predetermined purpose or message, but is free to subjective interpretation.

Your personal interpretation can and should change with time. This is OK.
