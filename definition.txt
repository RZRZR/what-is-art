Art is an invitation to think.

Art gives us the catalysis to think about something new, or differently, without repercussion in our everyday lives.

Our lives are busy. We don't often get the invitation to think about something without being asked for an opinon.
That opinon could possibily effect your job or personal relationships. Or we're being sold something.
