Art is an invitation to think.

Our lives are busy. We don't often get the invitation to think about something without the hangs up to being asked for opinon,
of that opinon possibily effecting our job or personal relationships. Or we're being sold something.

Art gives us the invitation to think about something new, or differently, without repercussion on our everyday lives.
